            <h2 class="center">Our story</h2>
            <p>This domain was bought back in 2022, on the 4th of October, by Vince and Ben, sitting in an IT class. Their first version of the site was almost immediately deployed, based on the old <a class="alink" href="https://femboy.hu">beparanoid.de</a> source code. It kind of sucked, being honest, and included absolutely zero content. This redesign of the website done by Vince <i>and maybe Susa</i> will hopefully impress our IT teacher.</p>
            <br />
            <h2 class="center">About the tech</h2>
            <p>Since its activation, the site has been hosted on Nethely, with the free tier. The website itself uses vanilla XHTML and CSS. <i>(i'm suffering)</i></p>
            <br />
            <h2 class="center">The Future</h2>
            <p>I have plans to expand the site with some software and hardware recommendations, and also Susa wants to add a <b>How to racially segregate children</b> section for some reason.</p>
